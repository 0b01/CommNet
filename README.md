# Communication Neural Network (CommNet)

Ported to PyTorch from Torch. This network enables neural network based agents to communicate for cooperation.

Includes a simple lever task: each agent must pull a different lever after 2 communication passes. Since the agents have to cooperate, this is viewed as a sanity check for the implementation.

# Training

To train the network

```
python train.py
